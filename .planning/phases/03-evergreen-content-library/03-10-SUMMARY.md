# 03-10 Summary: Cutover and verification

- Removed the legacy Easter route tree, quiz/contact stores, unused assets, and legacy database tables after a private backup.
- Added permanent redirects from `/studies`, `/kviz`, and `/husvet` to the new information architecture.
- Passed reference tests, targeted lint, strict TypeScript, production build, live database checks, desktop/mobile visual review, route/404/sitemap/PDF checks, admin CRUD saves, and a complete PDF publication lifecycle.

## Post-launch hotfix — 2026-07-22

- Centered the constrained hero content column so it keeps the shared 16 px mobile and 130 px desktop gutter instead of touching the viewport edge.
- Added a minimal client-side mobile menu boundary that closes the native details menu when a navigation link is selected.
- Replaced the split footer attribution with the requested single Revelation 22:17 quotation line.
